# Fashion Class Classification using Machine Learning

This Jupyter Notebook (`fashion_classification.ipynb`) contains a machine learning model for classifying fashion items into different classes. The model is trained using a custom dataset of fashion images.

## Overview

The notebook consists of the following sections:

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: Loading the fashion dataset and preprocessing the data for training the model.

2. **Model Training**: Training a machine learning model (e.g., decision tree, random forest, or support vector machine) on the preprocessed data.

3. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating the performance of the trained model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

4. **Prediction**: Making predictions on new fashion images using the trained model.

## Usage

To run the notebook and reproduce the results:

1. **Setup Environment**: Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed in your Python environment. If not, install it using pip:

    ```
    pip install notebook
    ```

2. **Open Notebook**: Open the `fashion_classification.ipynb` notebook using Jupyter Notebook:

    ```
    jupyter notebook fashion_classification.ipynb
    ```

3. **Run Cells**: Run each cell in the notebook sequentially to load the data, preprocess it, train the model, and make predictions.

## Customization

You can customize the notebook and experiment with different machine learning algorithms, hyperparameters, and preprocessing techniques to improve the classification performance.
